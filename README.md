The theme of the project is a web product for the "POTR POTS" store, which produce pots for plants
When I created this page, I used the BEM site development methodology.
A varied amount of elements positioning was also used
The SCSS extension, which is one of the syntactic forms of the Sass preprocessor, was used to write the styles.
Using SCSS made things easier with features like nesting and mixins.
